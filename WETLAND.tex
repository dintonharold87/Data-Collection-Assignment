\section{INTRODUCTION}
Our country is comprised of so many wetlands/swamps in each of the different regions of the country.And all life in the country as we know depends on water to survive be it animals or human beings.Yet water pollution is a very real threat to our survival.It is considered the world's biggest health risk,threatening not only humans, but also the other plants and animals that rely on water to survive.
\subsection{Data collection Concept}
Due to this problem,I decided to collect data on the different swamps in different regions of Uganda that is to say western region,central region,eastern region and northern region.This data includes the number of swamps in each region,the photograph of atleast one swamp in the region and where it is located on the map.My intention of collecting this kind of data was to find out how the different swamps are being polluted and which region in the country pollutes the swamps the most and how the problem of water pollution can be solved in Uganda.
\section{Causes of Water Pollution}
\subsection{Sewage and Wastewater}
Untreated sewage water is problematic in Uganda and most developing countries with insufficient sanitation.
\subsection{Industrial Waste}
Many industrial plants in Uganda use fresh water to dispose of their waste,polluting wetlands  and swamps.
\subsection{Marine Dumping}
Litter is disposed off in wetlands and swamps.
\section{Effects of Water Pollution}
Raw sewage in water causes environmental contammination and human illnesses like cholera.


water polluatants can harm or poison animals and humans.


Excessive organic matter in swamps can cause entrophication issues.\\
